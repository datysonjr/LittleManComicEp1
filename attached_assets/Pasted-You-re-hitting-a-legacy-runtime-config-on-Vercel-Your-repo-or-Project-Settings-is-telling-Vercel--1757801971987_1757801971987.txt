You’re hitting a legacy runtime config on Vercel. Your repo (or Project Settings) is telling Vercel to use now-php without a pinned version, so the build aborts:

Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example now-php@1.0.0.

What to do (fastest path)

If this is just a static site (HTML/CSS/JS or Vite build) and you don’t need any serverless functions:
	1.	Remove legacy config files from the repo root if they exist:
	•	vercel.json or now.json
	2.	Make sure there’s no api/ folder (Vercel treats /api as serverless functions).
	3.	Commit → push to GitHub → Redeploy on Vercel.

That alone usually fixes it.

If you do need functions (Node or PHP)

A) Node functions
	•	Ensure you’re not referencing now-php anywhere.
	•	Optional (pin Node runtime per-route):

{
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.ts": { "runtime": "nodejs20.x" },
    "api/**/*.js": { "runtime": "nodejs20.x" }
  }
}


	•	Keep any build/output settings you need (see template below).

B) PHP functions
	•	Replace the legacy now-php with the modern, version-pinned runtime:

{
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.php": { "runtime": "vercel-php@0.7.0" }
  }
}

Any recent 0.x is fine as long as it’s pinned. The key is include the version.

Commit → push → Redeploy.

Clean vercel.json templates

Static (no functions)

{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist"
}

(If you’re not using a build step, omit buildCommand and set "outputDirectory": ".".)

With Node functions + Vite

{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.ts": { "runtime": "nodejs20.x" },
    "api/**/*.js": { "runtime": "nodejs20.x" }
  }
}

With PHP functions

{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.php": { "runtime": "vercel-php@0.7.0" }
  }
}

Also check Vercel Project Settings (one-time)
	•	Settings → Functions → Default Runtime
If you see a legacy runtime (e.g., now-php) or anything blank/odd, set it to Node.js 20.x (unless you truly need PHP and are pinning it in vercel.json).

Quick Replit checklist for this repo
	1.	In Replit file tree, search for:
	•	vercel.json, now.json, any "now-php" or "vercel-php" strings.
	2.	If the project is static: delete the config and any /api folder.
	3.	If using Vite: ensure package.json has:

"scripts": { "build": "vite build" }


	4.	Commit in Replit:

git add -A
git commit -m "fix: remove legacy now-php / pin correct runtime"
git push origin main


	5.	Redeploy on Vercel.

If you paste your current vercel.json (or confirm whether you have an /api folder), I’ll rewrite it precisely for your setup.
